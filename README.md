# NAME TBD (accepting suggestions)

This repo contains only the hardware for the project.

The programer to rule them all, the development of this programmer arised from the need of a unlimited/free (as in freedom), open-source, capable programmer.
Based on OpenOCD capabilities and the FT4232H USB-Multiprotocol IC.

Planned features:
- Support for JTAG, SWD and SPI programming, possibly more. this allows it to program most of mcu fmilies arround and also FPGA's
- logic level converting allows interfacing with hardware from 1.8V to 5V.
- modular, 2 general comunication ports/connections to interface with future modules.
    module possibility
    - power monitoring/tracing module (collectiong project power consumption data)
    - external digitally adjustable supply module.
    - external comunication modules (SPI, I2C, CAN, etc.).
- SWO Port Or Uart for debbuging applications.
- No feature creeping (lol, i try), just what makes sense and is usefull for the programmer.
